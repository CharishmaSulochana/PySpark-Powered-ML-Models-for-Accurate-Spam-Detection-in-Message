# PySpark-Powered-ML-Models-for-Accurate-Spam-Detection-in-Message

# Problem Statement:
Text classification for spam detection is a crucial task in natural language processing (NLP). The challenge involves training a model to classify text messages as either spam or ham (non-spam) based on the content of the messages. With the proliferation of spam messages across various communication channels, such as emails and text messages, an efficient spam detection system is essential to filter out unwanted messages and improve user experience. The objective is to implement and compare different machine learning models to identify the most effective approach for spam detection.

# Abstract:
This project focuses on text classification for spam detection using PySpark and NLP techniques. The goal is to develop a model capable of accurately distinguishing between spam and ham messages to improve communication efficiency and user experience. Natural Language Processing (NLP) plays a crucial role in analyzing and understanding textual data, making it suitable for tasks like text classification. The project involves data preparation, text preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, consists of text messages labeled as spam or ham. PySpark, a Python library for Apache Spark, is utilized for data processing and machine learning tasks. Various machine learning models, including Naïve Bayes, SVM, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, are trained and evaluated to identify the most effective approach for spam detection. The results indicate that SVM achieves the highest accuracy score among the models evaluated, making it the preferred choice for spam detection. Future work includes extending the model for multilingual spam detection, incorporating ensemble methods, utilizing external data sources, and implementing privacy-preserving techniques.

# Dataset:
The dataset, named 'spam.csv', is sourced from Kaggle and consists of 5572 rows and 2 columns. Each row contains a text message along with its corresponding class label, indicating whether the message is spam or ham. The dataset is used for training and testing machine learning models for spam detection.

# Methodology:
Data Set Preparation: Removing null values, tokenization, and removal of stop words.

Text Preprocessing: Cleaning and preprocessing text data to prepare it for analysis.

Text Representation: Using bag of words, word2vec, and TF-IDF for feature extraction.

Feature Extraction: Extracting relevant features from the text data to train the machine learning models.

Training and Testing the Data: Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

Model Training: Training machine learning models, including Naïve Bayes, SVM, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, using PySpark.

Evaluation: Evaluating the trained models using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores.

Model Selection: Identifying the best-performing model for spam detection based on evaluation metrics.

# SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique):
In our project, we employ SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) as an oversampling technique to address imbalanced datasets in spam detection. Imbalanced datasets occur when one class (e.g., spam) is significantly underrepresented compared to the other class (e.g., ham) in the dataset. This imbalance can lead to biased model performance, as the model may tend to favor the majority class.

# Python Libraries:
PySpark

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Scikit-learn

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

# Proposed Framework:
In our project, we have chosen PySpark as the framework to work on spam detection. PySpark seamlessly integrates the use of Python with Apache Spark, a powerful distributed computing framework. PySpark provides a Python API for Apache Spark, enabling efficient and scalable data processing and machine learning tasks.PySpark includes MLlib, a scalable machine learning library that provides various algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, and collaborative filtering. MLlib enables us to train and evaluate machine learning models at scale using distributed computing capabilities of Apache Spark.

# Conclusion:
In conclusion, the project successfully implements text classification for spam detection using PySpark and NLP techniques. By evaluating different machine learning models, it is determined that SVM achieves the highest accuracy score among the models evaluated, making it the preferred choice for spam detection. The developed spam detection system demonstrates the effectiveness of NLP in analyzing and understanding textual data. Future work includes extending the model for multilingual spam detection, incorporating ensemble methods, utilizing external data sources, and implementing privacy-preserving techniques.

# Future Work:
Multilingual Spam Detection: Extend the model to support multiple languages for detecting spam messages in various languages.
Ensemble Methods: Explore the use of ensemble techniques such as bagging, boosting, and stacking to improve model performance.
Incorporating External Data: Utilize external data sources such as blacklists and whitelists to enhance the model's capability in predicting spam messages.
Privacy-Preserving Spam Detection: Develop privacy-preserving techniques such as federated learning to ensure user privacy while detecting spam messages.
